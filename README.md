# Sales analysis of AtliQ hardwares | PowerBi

## Problem

AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in computer hardware and peripherals, serves clients across multiple branches throughout India. However, the sales director is grappling with numerous challenges in gauging the business's performance and identifying current issues. Sales figures are below expectations and declining steadily. When the director contacts regional managers for updates on sales and market conditions, they tend to sugarcoat the truth, inundating him with Excel files instead of providing transparent insights. This approach only adds to the director's frustration, as the human tendency to avoid grappling with raw numbers exacerbates the situation.

## Solution

1. Conducted a comprehensive analysis of data using SQL to enhance insights.
2. Integrated the SQL dataset into PowerBI for streamlined visualization.
3. Implemented ETL processes and conducted thorough data cleansing on the imported dataset.
4. Standardized currency types in transactions through currency conversion for consistency.
5. Developed key performance measures and utilized them to generate compelling visuals in PowerBI.
6. Incorporated feedback from stakeholders post-initial report review, refining the report accordingly.
